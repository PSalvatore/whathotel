        <p id="reveal"><br> WhatHotel is a site where travelers can connect easily and quickly. Guests staying at a particular
            hotel can provide information to our database that will allow friends, family, or colleagues
            to meet up with them without a hassle. Members of WhatHotel can also register for their own
            rooms and even request rooms to stay in.</p>
